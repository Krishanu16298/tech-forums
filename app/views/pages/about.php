            <h2>About the Website!</h2>
            <p>In this website I have used a rudimentary framework built by myself.</p><p>In this website I have used a nice NewsAPI function to display news to keep you updated on tech related topics.</p>
            <p>I have also used proper validation for registering or logging in of users.</p>
            <p>I also used Bootstrap and fontawesome to make this website look awesome!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>About the framework!</h2>
            <p>This basic framework follows the <b>Model View Controller (MVC)</b> workflow. It also comes with a MYSQL PDO functionality to ease the database use.</p>
            <br>
            <p>P.S.: Don't mind the copyright below! its just for show.</p>
